# Circuit-Solver (linked list)
•	Developed a circuit-solving software using C++

•	Integrated programming with knowledge from Circuit Analysis (Kirchhoff’s Current Law, Ohm's Law, Voltage Divider, etc.)

•	The program allows the user to place resistors in a network and it will solve for the voltages at all nodes
